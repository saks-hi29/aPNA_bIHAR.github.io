        <h2>HISTORY OF ECONOMY</h2>
        <h5>Mauryan</h5>
        <p>The Magadha economy, under Mauryan royal government, depended mainly on agriculture and the state owned
            large farm lands for cultivation. The other income of the state came from the taxes levied on agriculture,
            land, trade, and industrial products such as handicrafts.[19] Mauryan agriculture had two type of
            landholdings, one were the Rashtra type of holdings which were the direct descendants of the holdings of the
            former tribal oligarchies who had been subjugated in pre-Mauryan times. The Rashtra landholdings were
            independent of the state machinery in their internal functioning and administration. Their only obligation
            was the regular payment of the Rashtra taxes to the state. The second major type of landholdings were the
            Sita landholdings. These were formed by clearing forest lands with the help of the tribesmen whose tribal
            way of life had been systematically and annihilated by the Mauryan statecraft.Rice, Wheat, Coarse
            grains, Sesame, Pepper, Saffron, Pulses, Linseed, mustard, vegetables and fruits of various kinds and
            sugarcane were grown. The state owned huge farms and these were cultivated by slaves and farm labourers.
            Water Reservoir and dam were built during this period and they were measured and distributedThe chief
            industries were mining, metallurgy, jewellery, pot making, textile. The trade was regulated by the state.
            Artisans and the craftsmen were specially protected by the state and any offences against them were severely
            punished. Guilds were powerful institutions during this period and they provided economic, political and
            judicial powers to craftsmen. The chief of the guild was called Jesthaka. A few guilds issued their own
            coins. These guilds also made donations to learned Brahmans and to the destitute.The Mauryan empire
            supplied western countries with Indigo and other medicinal substances, cotton, silk. Trade was carried out
            in both land and sea. Godowns, Warehouses were built and special provisions were made to protect the trade
            routes. The state controlled the weights and measures.</p>

        <h5>Sher Shah Reforms</h5>
        <p>In the 1540s Sher Shah, the ruler of Bihar and northern India, introduced measures that included laws to
            ensure that peasants were not cheated and that all were treated equally irrespective of religion and class.
            Sher Shah built the Grand Trunk Road stretching from Bengal to Peshawar, which is in use even today. He
            introduced a coin named rupia, to which the modern Indian Rupee system can be traced and also introduced the
            levy of custom duties. The empire stretched from Bengal in the east to Indus in the west. Sher Shah divided
            his empire into 47 sarkars which were further subdivided into parganas for ease of administration.[22] The
            reforms were an indication of the economic sophistication of the Bihar region during Muslim government.</p>

        <h5>Colonial</h5>
        <p>During colonial period the rural as well as the urban economy of Bihar saw a gradual change and challenge
            for its sustainability. The villages here were never just an agri-based model, rather a holistic and
            integrated system which gave all its people a respectable job and sufficient income out of it. These
            small-scale industries were directly processing the agricultural output and helping the villages </p>

        <h5>Post-Independence</h5>
        <h6>1947 – 1979</h6>
        <p>The sugar and vegetable oil industries were flourishing sectors of undivided Bihar. Until the mid fifties 25%
            of
            India's sugar output was from Bihar; 50% of horticulture products were produced here. Rice and wheat were
            around
            29% and Bihar was truly an agriculture power house in the days after independence. Dalmianagar was a large
            agro
            – industrial town. There have been attempts to industrialize the northern half of the state between 1950 and
            1980: an oil refinery in Barauni, Barauni Fertiliser Plant, Barauni Thermal Power Station, a motor scooter
            plant
            at Fatuha , and a power plant at Muzaffarpur, Bharat Wagon and Engineering at Muzaffarpur and Mokama.There
            are
            many factors behind the economic decline of Bihar. Many in Bihar blame the freight equalisation scheme, poor
            political vision, under-investments in the key sectors of agriculture, infrastructure and education. Others
            view
            cultural and political factors as reasons behind economic decline, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. 'state
            incapacity by design', where the ruling establishment under Lalu Prasad and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)
            deliberately limited government presence through reduced hiring and expenditures, in an attempt to ensure
            that
            upper castes did not benefit. Such a strategy also had value when looked at through the lens of electoral
            politics, as it enabled the crystallization of a number of poorer and historically oppressed groups into
            vote
            banks that would see Lalu Prasad as their champion . Along with it the terrible governance that came with
            the
            Yadavs of Bihar being in power bought the economy to its knees.

            The government, between 1947 and 2000, supported the industrialisation of the southern half of the state
            rather
            than the north was the major cause of the lack of industrialisation in north Bihar. The undivided Bihar
            government developed important industrial cities like Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, and Ranchi in the south.
            The
            north remained the agricultural heart of the undivided state. The two regions complimented each other.</p>

        <h6>1980 – 1989</h6>

        <p>Indian government data from 1980 to 1990 (see Economic Indicators below) also show that the GSDP of the
            undivided Bihar grew by 72% in this period despite the socio-economic problems of the state. The data also
            shows
            that the state GSDP grew by 49% between 1980 and 1985, which means that the economy was one of the fastest
            growing in the country during the early 1980s as well. In 1980 undivided Bihar had a population of 70
            million.[24] In the 1980s, the five-year plan called for $4 billion in investment in Bihar. By 1987, the $4
            billion translated into $12 investment per person. Economists claimed that a huge budget deficit is spurring
            inflation, eroding the standard of living of the poorest sections of the people of Bihar. In agriculture,
            the
            largest sector, the government failed to invest in the production of agriculture and instead opted to import
            food grains from other parts of India. This decision helped facilitate problems faced by agricultural
            workers in
            the late 1980s and paved for the victory of Lalu Prasad in 1989.</p>
        <h6>1990–2005</h6>
        <p>It collapse during this time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Caste and Criminalisation</li>
            <p>The Rashtriya Janata Dal leader, Lalu Prasad's, support of social justice ensured that politics was
                dominated by Mandal politics and caste rather than development during this period.</p>
            <li>Non RJD Factors</li>
            <p>Bihar's share of revenue from the Central pool declined by Rs. 5,000 crores as the centre's revenue
                collection had gone down. This, coupled with the fact that the government failed to get its plan
                allocation released because it could not contribute the matching non-plan grant, aggravated the
                financial crisis.[28] The division of Bihar in 2000, when the industrially advanced and mineral-rich
                southern-half of the state was carved out to form the separate state of Jharkhand</p>
            <li>Economic Indicators under the RJD</li>
            <p>n the non-agricultural sector, the growth rate in Bihar was 6.62% against 6.61% for India as a whole
                during the 1980s. During the 1990s when the growth rate in Bihar was 3.19%, while for India it rose to
                7.25%. This change was reflected in the per capita income as well. Per capita income in Bihar grew by
                2.45% during the 1980s, against 3.32% per cent in India as a whole. In the 1990s, per capita income grew
                by 0.12% per cent in Bihar, as against 4.08% per cent in India.</p>
