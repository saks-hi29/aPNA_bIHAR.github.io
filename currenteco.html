      <h5>Nitish Kumar reign</h5>
        <p>After Nitish Kumar came to power, the Finance Ministry under Sushil Kumar Modi gave priority to create investment opportunities for big industrial houses like Reliance. Improvements in law and order, with a more proactive bureaucracy led to a gradual improvement in the economy of the state. NDTV dubbed this as the "Quiet Transformation".[33] In January 2009, Nitish Kumar was awarded the CNN IBN Indian Politician of the Year award for helping put Bihar on the sustainable development and growth track.[34] Again in January 2009, the ASSOCHAM Investment Meter stated that the private sector invested over Rs 304 crore in Bihar during the third quarter of 2008.</p>
