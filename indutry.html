        <h2>INDUTRIES</h2>
      <p>Begusarai is the industrial and financial capital of Bihar. It has major industries like Barauni Refinery, NTPC, Barauni (BTPS), Barauni Fertiliser Plant (HURL, Barauni), Sudha Dairy Plant, Pepsi Bottling Plant.

        Hajipur, Dalmianagar, Munger and Barauni are the major industrial cities in Bihar[121] The capital city, Patna, is one of the better-off cities in India when measured by per capita income.[relevant?][122]
        
        The Finance Ministry has sought to create investment opportunities for big industrial houses like Reliance Industries. Further developments have taken place in the growth of small industries, improvements in IT infrastructure, a software park in Patna, Darbhanga, Bhagalpur,[123] and the completion of the expressway from the Purvanchal border through Bihar to Jharkhand. In August 2008, a Patna-registered company called the Security and Intelligence Services[124] took over the Australian guard and mobile patrol services business of American conglomerate, United Technologies Corporation (UTC). SIS is registered and taxed in Bihar.[125][relevant?]
        
        Prior to prohibition, Bihar emerged as a brewery hub with numerous production units.[126] In August 2018, United Breweries Limited announced it would begin production of non-alcoholic beer at its previously defunct brewery in Bihar</p>
